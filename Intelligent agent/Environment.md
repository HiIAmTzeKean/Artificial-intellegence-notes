# Environment

1. Accessible vs inaccessible
    - if agent is able to perceive the complete state of the environment (portion of environment hidden?)

2. Deterministic vs non-deterministic
   - if next state is completely determined by action and state taken by agent (any randomness?)

3. Episodic vs sequential
    - if each set of moves are independent of each other or if past action determines future possible states

4. Static vs dynamic
    - if environment changes as agent is finding solution

5. Discrete vs continuous
    - if there are limited possible perception and action

# Designing problem solving agent

1. Goal formulation
    - allow testing for if current state is goal state

2. Problem formulation
    - information used by agent to determine what action to take
    - many types of problems such as CSP...

3. Search process
    - uninformed search
    - informed search

4. Action execution
    - considers expected outcomes and takes best action

## Measure problem-solving performance

Evaluate search cost and execution cost
Search techniques

- different time complexities and resource usage

Execution cost:

- path cost of action. eg. distance needed to travel based on search result

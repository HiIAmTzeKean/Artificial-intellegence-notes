# The intelligent agent

Agent perceives through sensors and acts through effectors

## Types of agent

1. Rational agent
    - Does the right thing by always maximising performance
    - rationality will then depend on data train set, knowledge on environment etc

2. Autonomous agents
    - does not only use built-in knowledge on environment
    - agent can adapt to changes in environment

3. Simple reflex agents
    - rule based logic, and acts when condition is met

4. Reflex agent with state
    - agent stores state which it uses as a variable in deciding its action
    - agent still operates on rule, but now with memory

5. Goal based agent
    - concept of reflex agent with state with additonal variable of goal
    - agent is evaluates the actions needed to reach goal state

6. Utility based agent
    - idea of goal based agent with optimisation
    - searches best solution to solve problem
